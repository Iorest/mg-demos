# CBPlusUI

This demo is a simplified edition of a real product called `CBPlus`,
which is developed by [Joobot Technologies].

Note that the system services are fake ones in the demo. You may need
to replace them with a real mechanism to interact with the underlying
services. In the real product, we use `ubus` of OpenWRT as the
mechanism to interact with the system services.

Also note that [Joobot Technologies] reserves the copyright of
all images used by this demo. You can not use, copy, modify,
and/or distribute the images with your programs.

The reserved images located in the directory `res/images`.
